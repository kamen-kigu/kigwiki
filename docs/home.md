# Welcome to KIG.WIKI

## About This Site

Welcome to kig.wiki, what will hopefully be the ultimate resource for kigurumi mask enthusiasts and beginners alike! This site is dedicated to providing comprehensive documentation on everything related to kigurumi masks. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or a seasoned enthusiast seeking advanced tips, we hope to have valuable information here.

The aim of this site is to be a communal resource where any and all can contribute so that we can all make our best, most informed decisions when it comes to kigurumi masks and all that goes along with.

This site does not aim to be any one contributor's or community's soapbox, nor is the aim to tell anyone how to do things or which maker(s) or methods to use. Given the uniqueness of masks, and of performers ourselves, there often is no one size fits all nor 'right' or 'wrong' choices, however we aim to ensure people can make their most educated decisions given the spectrum of information at hand.

## Kigs are getting ready, please wait warmly! 

Please note that kig.wiki is currently a work in progress. We are actively working on adding more content and improving the existing documentation. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to build and refine this resource.
